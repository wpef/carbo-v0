# Implementation Plan: Unmapped Fields Detection

**Branch**: `016-unmapped-fields-detection` | **Date**: 2026-04-02 | **Spec**: `specs/016-unmapped-fields-detection/spec.md`

## Summary

Detect and display unmapped source fields and unmapped required destination properties for each object mapping. Enforce Constitution Principle III (Data Fidelity) -- no field is silently ignored. The consultant can mark unmapped source fields as "intentionally excluded" to distinguish deliberate omissions from forgotten ones. This feature provides the data; the field mapping view (012) and object detail modal (011) consume it for display.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x on Next.js 14+ (App Router)
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js Route Handlers, Prisma ORM, shadcn/ui, Connector Interface types (000)
**Storage**: SQLite via Prisma (FieldExclusion table linked to ObjectMapping)
**Testing**: Vitest (unit + integration)
**Target Platform**: Local-first web application (localhost)
**Project Type**: Web application (unified Next.js)
**Constraints**: Computation must handle 200+ source fields per object without perceivable delay

## Constitution Check

| # | Principle | Status | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| I | Spec-First | PASS | spec.md approved |
| II | Readability | PASS | Simple set-difference computation, no complex algorithms |
| III | Data fidelity | PASS | **Core feature**: explicitly implements Principle III -- every unmapped field is visible |
| IV | Tests on real data | PASS | Tests with realistic field counts, including objects with 100+ fields |
| V | Idempotence | PASS | Exclusion is a toggle; computation is pure read |
| VI | Traceability | PASS | Exclusion/un-exclusion actions logged to audit trail |
| VII | Observability | PASS | Console logs for unmapped field computation results |
| VIII | Modularity | PASS | Isolated behind UnmappedFieldsService; data consumed by 011 and 012 via API |

**Structure Decision**: Unmapped fields data is exposed via an API endpoint on the object mapping. The UI panel is integrated into the field mapping view (012). Exclusions are a separate CRUD endpoint.
