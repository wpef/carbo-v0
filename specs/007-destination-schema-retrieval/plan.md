# Implementation Plan: Destination Schema Retrieval

**Branch**: `007-destination-schema-retrieval` | **Date**: 2026-04-02 | **Spec**: `specs/007-destination-schema-retrieval/spec.md`

## Summary

After connecting a destination, retrieve the full list of destination objects and persist them as a schema snapshot. Follows the same CURRENT/PREVIOUS rotation and diff pattern established in 003-source-schema-retrieval, reusing `SchemaSnapshot` and `SchemaObject` entities. The key difference: destination schema retrieval fetches ALL objects (no selection step for destination).

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14+ (App Router), Prisma ORM
**Storage**: Neon Postgres via Prisma — reuses `SchemaSnapshot` + `SchemaObject` tables from 003 (isolated per tenant)
**Testing**: Vitest (unit + integration, against real Postgres via Neon branch or Docker)
**Target Platform**: Next.js 14+ (App Router) sur Vercel
**Project Type**: Web application (unified Next.js project)
**Performance Goals**: Schema retrieval completes in under 60 seconds for up to 2000 objects
**Constraints**: Max 2 snapshots per connection (CURRENT + PREVIOUS). Destination objects are not selected — all are available for mapping.
**Scale/Scope**: 1 API route, 1 service, 1 UI section, schema diff reuse

## Constitution Check

| # | Principle | Status | Justification |
|---|-----------|--------|---------------|
| I | Spec-First | PASS | spec.md approved |
| II | Readability | PASS | Mirrors source schema retrieval pattern from 003 |
| III | Data fidelity | PASS | 100% of objects from adapter preserved in snapshot |
| IV | Tests on real data | PASS | Integration tests with demo adapter returning realistic object list |
| V | Idempotence | PASS | Re-retrieving schema produces clean CURRENT/PREVIOUS rotation |
| VI | Traceability | PASS | Every retrieval logged to audit trail |
| VII | Observability | PASS | Console logs for retrieval start, object count, diff summary |
| VIII | Modularity | PASS | Reuses SchemaSnapshot/SchemaObject; service isolated behind public API |
| IX | Human-in-the-loop | PASS | Symétrique à 003 — rotation CURRENT→PREVIOUS sans re-binding silencieux ; refresh ne déclenche jamais d'auto-remap de destination |

**Structure Decision**: The schema retrieval service from 003 is generic (works with any connection). The only new code is the route handler (scoped to destination) and the destination schema UI page. Object list and diff components are shared with source.
